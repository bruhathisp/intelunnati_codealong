## Data Preparation:

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a popular dataset used for image classification tasks. The code provided prepares the data for training, validation, and testing. Here are the steps involved in data preparation:

* Import Libraries: The necessary libraries for data handling and preprocessing are imported, including PyTorch, torchvision.transforms, FashionMNIST dataset, and DataLoader.

* Data Transformation: A series of transformations are applied to the images to preprocess them before feeding into the neural network. The transformations include converting the images to tensors and normalizing the pixel values to a range of [-1, 1].

* Dataset Split: The training dataset is split into a training set and a validation set. The code uses 80% of the training data for training and 20% for validation.

* Data Loaders: DataLoaders are created for the training, validation, and testing sets. These DataLoaders enable efficient batching and shuffling of data during training.
